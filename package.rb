	description: 'Event-making is a thankless discipline because it often requires a lot of patience to do things that can be very easy to conceive (I\'m thinking of gauges, for example).
The purpose of this script is to offer some easy-to-use commands in order to help the making of event-based systems less painful.
Of course, this script won\'t allow you to compete with experienced scripters, but I honestly think that it can be a good initiation to programmation and to the joy of going further with event making.'
